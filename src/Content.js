        <p>Do you ever go to the grocery store and stand in the wine section, not remembering if you have ever tried a specific wine before and if you liked it or not? </p> 
        <p>You are not alone!  </p>
        <p> Therefore, I present you Wine-O-Clock!
        Add the wines you bought to the form below and give them a wine-rating from 1-5, so every time you go to the store you can look in your app and check if you have already tried this wine!
        </p>
